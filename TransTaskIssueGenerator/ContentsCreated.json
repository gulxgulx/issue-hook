In this post I’ll explain why that’s not generally the case. I’ll highlight the difference between testing a unit of code which supports async behavior, as opposed code which is inherently asynchronous. I’ll also show how promise-based async code lends itself to clean and succinct unit tests which can be tested in a clear, readable way while still validating async behaviour.\n"},"https://martinfowler.com/articles/modernMockingTools.html":{"Title":"Modern Mocking Tools and Black Magic","Href":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/modernMockingTools.html","Credits":"Brett L.

In it I examine a few software development projects that ThoughtWorks has done which are, to some degree \"enterprise transforming\". The talk (and paper) are aimed at a non-technical audience. From the projects I draw out some common lessons learned. In essence these are: Deliver Frequently, Expect Surprises, Get High Level Executive Support, Treat Business and Software Development as Partners, Choose Technology for the Future, People are The Critical Success Factor, and Keep Learning. A version of this article was recently published in Resource magazine.\n\t"},"https://martinfowler.com/articles/ciWithCom.html":{"Title":"Continuous Integration with Visual C++ and COM","Href":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/ciWithCom.html","Credits":"by William E.

While the principles remain\n  largely unchanged from project to project, the implementation of\n  this practice can vary considerably.
